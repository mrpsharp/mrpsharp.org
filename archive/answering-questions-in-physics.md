It is essential that all physics questions are answered clearly showing how the answer was arrived at.  This may seam like a waste of time for trivial questions, but it is important to get into good habits early on.  The key steps are:

1. Quote the equation you will use to solve the problem. 
2. Add the values into the equation in standard units. *It is better to use standard form as well to avoid miscounting zeros*.
3. Quote the answer **to the correct number of significant figures**.
4. Add the correct units

That is all there is to it!  If you are not doing this you will have your work handed back!

## Example
1. Find the frequency of light with a wavelength of 577 nm.
