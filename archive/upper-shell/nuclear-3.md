1. A radioactive source has an activity of 1000 Bq. It is injected into a man's blood stream and given time to mix evenly throughout his blood. 10ml of his blood is then extracted and and the activity is found to be 1.6Bq. How much blood is in his body? *Assume the total activity of the source does not change.*

1. A Geiger-Muller tube detects 1% of the activity of a Strontium-90 source. If it records 12000 events in one minute, what is the activity of the source in Bq?

1. &nbsp;
	1. Explain what is meant by background radiation.
	1. Explain the difference between natural background radiation and artificial background radiation.
	1. Give three different sources of background radiation. Say whether your examples are natural or artificial.

1. The activity of a radioactive sample is measured. The activity, corrected for background radiation, is found to be 240Bq. The activity is measured again after 1 hour 30 minutes and is now 30Bq. What is the half-life of the sample?

1. A sample of the radioisotope xenon-133, mass 40 g, is delivered to a hospital for use at 9.00 am on 3rd May. The half-life of the isotope is 5 days.
	1. What is meant by the term 'radioisotope'?
	1. How much xenon will be left at 9.00 am on 18th May?
