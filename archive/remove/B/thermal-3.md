1. Many living substances are held together by hydrogen bonds with bond energy of the order 20 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>.
    1. Calculate this energy in Joule per particle. 
    1. Calculate the ration ε/kT at 300 K.
    1. Find the temperature at which ε = kT.  Comment.

1. The energy required to break the bonds in a ceramic is of the order 1 MJ mol<sup>-1</sup>.  
    1. Explain why ceramics are stable, even at temperatures of 6000 K.
    1. Estimate the temperature at which ceramics may begin to break up.

1. If the atmosphere had a constant temperature, the pressure, p, at height, h, above sea level would be given by: $$\frac{p}{p_0} =e^{\frac{-mgh}{kT}}$$ where m is the mass of a molecule and p0, is the pressure at the surface.
    1. For nitrogen molecules, relative molecular mass 28, estimate the height at which the pressure is 1/10th that at the surface, assuming a temperature of 300 K.
    1. Repeat the calculation for T = 200 K.
    1. Repeat the calculation in (a) for hydrogen molecules, relative molecular mass 2.  Comment on the result.

1. Van der Waals proposed modifications to \(PV = RT\), the equation of state for and ideal gas.  The modified equation is: $$\left(P + \frac{a}{V^2}\\right)\left(V-b\right) = RT$$ where a and b are constants.
    1. What are the units, or dimensions, of a and b?
    1. What is the physical meaning of b and a?
    1. Calculate the pressure of 2.00 mol of nitrogen at 200K contained in a volume of 6.00x10<sup>-3</sup> m<sup>3</sup> if a = 0.140 SI units and b = 3.90 x 10<sup>-5</sup> SI units.
    1. What would the pressure be if the gas was ideal?
