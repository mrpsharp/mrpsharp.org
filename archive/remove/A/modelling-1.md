1. A capacitor of capacitance 10 &micro;F is connected to a 12V supply.  What are the charges on each of its plates?

1. A camera flash unit stores 14.1 C of charge.
	1. Given that the charging voltage is 30 V, calculate the capacitance of the capacitor
	1. If the capacitor discharges in 20ms, calculate the average current of discharge.

1. A capacitor can be charged using a constant current source of 8 mA.  This is done to a 22 &micro;F capacitor and a high resistance voltmeter attached to the capacitor registers 740 mV.  For how long was the constant current source charging the capacitor?

1. A (discharged) 10 nF capacitor is joined in series with a 10 k&Omega; resistor, a low resistance ammeter, a switch and a 12V battery.
	1. Draw a circuit diagram for this arrangement.
	1. When the switch is first closed, what is:
		1. the p.d. across the capacitor,
		1. the p.d. across the resistor,
		1. the current,
		1. the charge on the capacitor plates.
	1. Calculate the same quantities when the switch has closed for some time and a steady state has been reached.
	1. If the capacitor had continued charging at a constant rate, how long would it have taken to fully charge?

1. Sketch a graph of Q against V for a capacitor and then answer the following questions.
	1. What does the gradient of the graph represent?
	1. What does the area under the graph represent (think about the units)?
	1. Using this information, or otherwise, derive a formula for the energy stored on a capacitor.

1. A capacitor of capacitance 16 &micro;F is connected to a 150 V d.c. supply.  What is the charge on the capacitor plates, and what is the energy stored?
