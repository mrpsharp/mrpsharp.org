# Materials
## Hooke's Law and Excel (double)  
* Introduction to Hooke's Law
* Create table and graph in Excel
* Moving from object properties to material properties

## Breaking Stress  
* Stress is the generalised equivalent of Force
* $\sigma=\frac{F}{A}$
* Measure breaking stress of copper & steel.
* Compare with published data [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength#Typical_tensile_strengths|Typical Values]]
* Discuss naming (UTS)

## Stress - Strain Graphs  
* Plot graph of stress - strain for material
* Demo with PASCO
* Show variation of strength and ductility
* Region of proportionality associated with elastic deformation
* Not always true - show elastic band
* Variation with temp - Liquid N

## Young Modulus of Cu  
* Carry out Young Modulus of Copper experiment (4/150E)
* Plot **F** against **x**
* Calculate using $E = k times frac{L}{A}$

## Microstructure of metals  
* Metallic bonding summary
* Metals can plastically deform by planes of atoms sliding over each other
* Theoretical energy required for crystal slip is much higher than is observed in practice
* Concept of a dislocation
* Sketch of a line dislocation and movement
//Bubble Raft Demo//

## Effect of grainsize on dislocations  
* Dislocation creep and grain size
* Copper annealing experiment (http://www.materialseducation.org/educators/mated-modules/docs/Work_Hardening_and_Annealing_of_Copper.pdf
