1. A spring of spring constant 30 Nm<sup>-1</sup> is stretched by 3 cm. Calculate
the force on the spring.

2. Two springs of spring constant 15 Nm<sup>-1</sup> are connected end to end. A
mass of 1.5 kg is hung on the end of it.
    1. Calculate the force acting on the system.
    1. Calculate the force acting on each spring.
    1. Calculate the extension of each individual spring.
    1. Hence, calculate the spring constant of the whole system.
    
3. Two springs are connected side by side, connected by a horizontal bar
at top and bottom. A mass of 500g is hung from the centre of the bar
so that the force is distributed equally over the two bars. The spring
constant is equal to 8 Nm<sup>-1</sup>.
    1. Calculate the total downward force.
    1. Calculate the downwards force on each spring.
    1. Hence, calculate the extension of each spring.
    1. Calculate the combined spring constant.
    
1. A long strip of rubber whose cross section measures 12 mm by 0.25 mm is pulled with a force of 3.0 N. 
    1. What is the tensile stress in the rubber?
    1. Another strip of rubber originally 90 mm long is stretched until it is 120 mm long.  What is the tensile strain? 

1. A marble column in a temple has dimensions 140 mm by 180 mm.
    1. What is its cross-sectional area in mm<sup>2</sup>?
    2. Convert this area to m<sup>2</sup>
    3. If the temple column supports a load of 10 kN, what is the compressive stress?
    4. The column is 5.0 m tall, and is compressed by 0.1 mm. What is the compressive strain when this happens?  
    5. Use your answers above to calculate the Young Modulus of the marble.
