# Physics 1

1. Two resistors in parallel have a combined resistance given by the equation: 

    $$ \frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} $$ 

    1.   Show algebraically that this can be re-written to give the expression (known as the 	“the product over the sum”):
    $$ R_{total} = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2} $$

    2. It is suggested this “product over sum” rule may be extended to three resistors as follows:
    $$ R_{total} = \frac{R_1 R_2 R_2}{R_1 + R_2 + R_3} $$
    *Without using algebra* describe whether or not you think this is likely to be correct.
    
2. Over the course of an hour a car averages 40.2 miles per gallon (mpg).  By considering the units or otherwise convert this value to litres per 100 km.  *(1 gallon = 4.55 litres; 1 mile = 1.6 km)*
