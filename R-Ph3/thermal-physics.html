## Ideal Gas Equation
1. At the start of a journey the air pressure inside a car tyre is 2.2 x 10<sup>5</sup> Pa and its temperature is 20 Â°C. At the end of the journey the temperature has risen to 38 Â°C. What is the new pressure? Assume the volume of the tyre is unchanged.
1. An air bubble is released by a diver at a depth where the external pressure and temperature are 4.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> Pa and 12 Â°C and rises to the surface where the pressure and temperature are 1.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> Pa and 16 Â°C. If the original volume of the bubble was 1.0 cm<sup>3</sup> calculate its volume at the surface.

## The Random Walk
You are going to create a model of a 2D random walk in excel.
1. Create a column entitled *N*. This column should count up from zero in increments of 1.
1. Create columns titled *A* - *Z*. These represent the particles in the model. The particles should begin at position 0 and increase or decrease by 1 with a 50/50 chance.
1. At the end of each row calculate the average position and the average of the absolute positions *(Type: =AVERAGE(ABS(B2:AA2)) and press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER)*

## The ideal gas equation
### Part I
Derive the ideal gas equation by following these steps:
1. Write an expression for the average rate of change of momentum of a particle with horizontal velocity *v<sub>x</sub>* bouncing between opposite walls of a box of length *L* and cross-sectional area *A*.
1. Now scale up the equation for *N* particles and write an expression for the pressure due to these particles on the wall of the box.
1. By considering the nature of the motion of the particle, replace *v<sub>x</sub>* with the speed *c*.

### Part II
1. Consider what assumptions you have made.
1. Derive an expression relating the pressure of a gas to its density.

## The ideal gas assumptions

Consider the following three assumptions:
1. collisions are elastic;
1. the particles have negligible volume compared to the container;
1. there are no inter-molecular forces between the particles.

Explain how these assumptions break down:
1. at low temperatures;
1. at high temperatures;
1. at high pressures.
