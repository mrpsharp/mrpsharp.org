## Ideal Gas Equation
1. At the start of a journey the air pressure inside a car tyre is 2.2 x 10<sup>5</sup> Pa and its temperature is 20 Â°C. At the end of the journey the temperature has risen to 38 Â°C. What is the new pressure? Assume the volume of the tyre is unchanged.
1. An air bubble is released by a diver at a depth where the external pressure and temperature are 4.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> Pa and 12 Â°C and rises to the surface where the pressure and temperature are 1.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> Pa and 16 Â°C. If the original volume of the bubble was 1.0 cm<sup>3</sup> calculate its volume at the surface.

## The Random Walk
You are going to create a model of a 2D random walk in excel.
1. Create a column entitled *N*. This column should count up from zero in increments of 1.
1. Create columns titled *A* - *Z*. These represent the particles in the model. The particles should begin at position 0 and increase or decrease by 1 with a 50/50 chance.
1. At the end of each row calculate the average position and the average of the absolute positions *(Type: =AVERAGE(ABS(B2:AA2)) and press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER)*
