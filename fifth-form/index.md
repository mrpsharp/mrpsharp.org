Before answering any Physics questions you must read and follow [Answering Questions in Physics](/answering-questions-in-physics.html).  **If you do not do this then you will find your answers returned!**

Below you will find a list of resources by topic, most of them preps.  You can print these out or complete them by hand on a computer.  Once all are marked I will publish the answers...
