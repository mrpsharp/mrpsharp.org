1. A wave passes along a spring with a wavelength of 80cm and a frequency of 5 Hz.
	1. Calculate the speed of the wave in cm/s.
	1. What would the new wavelength be if the frequency increased to 10Hz?

3.	Some ripples on the surface of a pond have a wavelength of 5 cm and travel across the pond at a speed of 20cm/s.  What is the frequency of the waves?

4.	1.	The radio waves which carry Radio 4 on the FM band are generated at a frequency of 93.5Mhz and travel at 300Mm/s.  What is the wavelength of these waves?
	1.	The radio waves which carry Five Live on the AM band have a wavelength of 330m and also travel at a speed of 300Mm/s, calculate their frequency in Hertz.
 
5.	Red light has a speed of 3 x 108m/s and a frequency of 5 x 10<sup>14</sup>Hz.  What is the wavelength of this wave?

6. Binary stars are predicted to emit gravitational waves with a frequency of around 10<sup>-2</sup> Hz.  What is the wavelength of such a wave?  (Look up the speed of gravitational waves!)
