This may seam like a waste of time for trivial questions, but it is important to get into good habits early on.  The key steps are:\n\n1. Quote the equation you will use to solve the problem. \n2. Add the values into the equation in standard units. *It is better to use standard form as well to avoid miscounting zeros*.\n3. Quote the answer **to the correct number of significant figures**.\n4. Add the correct units\n\nThat is all there is to it!  If you are not doing this you will have your work handed back!\n\n## Example\n1. Find the frequency of light with a wavelength of 577 nm.\n\n    ![](img/answering.gif)"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":805}]],"length":805}
