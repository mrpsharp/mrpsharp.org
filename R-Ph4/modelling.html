## The decay equation
1. A radioactive source has a half-life of 23 days.
  1. Calculate the decay constant in s<sup>-1</sup> of the radioactive source.
  1. If this source has an initial activity of 40 kBq, what will be its activity 10 days later?

1. The half-life of radium is 1620 years. How long will it take for the initial activity of a radium compound to fall to a fifth of its original value.

1. The activity of a radioactive source decreases by seven-eights of its initial value in 30 hours. Calculate the half-life and decay constant for this source.
