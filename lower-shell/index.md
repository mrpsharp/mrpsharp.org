# Welcome Lower Shell Physicists

Before answering any Physics questions you must read and follow [Answering Questions in Physics](/answering-questions-in-physics.html).  **If you do not do this then you will find your answers returned!**

Below you will find a list of resources by topic, most of them preps.  You can print these out or complete them by hand on a computer.  Once all are marked I will publish the answers...

You may also want to check out the following:
 * [The Physics Department Homepage](https://homepages.westminster.org.uk/physics/home.asp)
 * [The Internal Syllabus](https://homepages.westminster.org.uk/physics/lowershell/LShsyllabus.asp) *Note: this is a flexible document - if you are unsure about whether you need to know something speak to me before panicing!*
