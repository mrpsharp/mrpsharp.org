## Electricity I Revision

1. Define electric current and give two examples.
1. Below is the symbol equation defining current. Copy the equation and for each quantity write i) the quantity represented by the symbol; ii) the name of the unit; iii) the symbol used for the unit.
$$ I = \frac{Q}{t} $$
1. A mobile phone battery is described as having a capacity of 1200 mA-hours. This means that 1200 mA could be drawn for 1 hour.
  1. Calculate the charge stored by the battery.
  2. Calculate the number of electrons the battery can push around the circuit (e = 1.6 x 10<sup>-19</sup> C)
  3. If the battery lasts 8 hours, calculate the average current in that time. Express your answer:

      1. In mA.
      1. In standard units and scientific notation.
