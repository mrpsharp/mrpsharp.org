An experiment to test Boyle's law was carried out and returned the following readings:

*p* / kPa | *V* / cm<sup>3</sup>
----------|---------------------
102 | 40.5
143 | 28.7
178 | 23.4
200 | 20.7
233 | 17.8

1. Copy this table into Excel and format correctly

2. Plot a graph of *p* against *V*

3. Although illustrative, this graph does not confirm Boyle's law.  Plot and appropriate graph to test Boyle's Law and state your conclusion.

4. A party balloon has a volume of 1.5 litres and the pressure of the air inside it is 128 kPa.  It is squashed so its new volume is 1.3 litres.  What is the new pressure?

5. Sketch a graph to show pressure against 1/volume for a typical gas.  Sketch new lines on the graph to show how this would change if:
    1. the temperature was increased;
    2. the amount of gas decreased.
In each case above explain why the graph changes the way it does.
