Nuclear Reactors work by using a slow moving neutron to cause 235U to become 236U which then decays into two daughter isotopes and three neutrons.

1.  Complete the equation in which uranium-235 absorbs a neutron and then decays to form barium-141, a second daughter isotope and three neutrons.
    <div><sup>235</sup><sub>92</sub>U + <sup>1</sup><sub>0</sub>n &rarr; <sup>236</sup><sub>92</sub>U<sup>*</sup> &rarr;</div>

1. Excess energy is produced by this reaction in the form of kinetic energy in the daughter isotopes.  The excess energy is due to the fact that there is lost mass between the left and right sides of the equation.

    Using the data sheet, calculate:
    1. The total mass on the right hand side of the equation in atomic mass units. *Note: use the data below for the masses, not the simple nucleon number.*
    1. The change in mass between the uranium-236 and the right hand side.
    1. The change in mass in kg and hence the energy released per fission.

1. If this is the amount of energy produced by one 235U in the reactor, calculate:
    1. How many 235U nuclei there are in 1kg (just use a mass of 235 atomic mass units).
    1. The energy these nuclei would produce.
    1. This is known as the energy density.  Some other energy density figures are on the data sheet, how does the Uranium compare to fossil fuels?
