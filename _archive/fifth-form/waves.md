## Wave concepts
* Information and energy carried by waves or particles
* No net movement of the medium in a wave
* Examples of waves and particles
* Demonstration: transverse waves on a long spring
* Oscillation of each point in a wave
* Oscillations are out of step or phase
* Result is apparent movement of wave profile
* Oscillations are transverse
* Reflection and possible inversion
* Worked Example: transverse wave motion
* Demonstration: longitudinal waves on a slinky 
* Oscillations are longitudinal
* Worked Example: longitudinal wave motion
* Examples of longitudinal and transverse waves
* Water waves both longitudinal and transverse
* Both types have similar properties
* Sinusoidal wave profile and the equilibrium position
* How sinusoidal waveform can represent longitudinal waves
* Amplitude
* Wavelength


Equipment
: WX020 Slinky

## Wave velocity
* Velocity
* Frequency
* Period
* Derivation of \\( v = \frac{f}{\lambda} \\)
* Reminder of distance = speed x time
* Calculation of frequency of Radio 4 (1500m LW)
