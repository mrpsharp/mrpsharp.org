# Thermal Physics 1 - Gas Laws

1. Boyles Law is often quoted as *PV = k*.
    1. State the units of *k* in base units.
    2. Re-write the units of *k* in common units.  How would you describe it in words?

1. A car tyre contains air at a pressure of 1.90 x 10<sup>5</sup> Pa at 18<sup>o</sup>C.
    1. What will the pressure be at 25<sup>o</sup>C?
    2. By how much does the pressure rise for each increase of 1 degree celsius?
    3. What assumption have you made in the calculations above?
