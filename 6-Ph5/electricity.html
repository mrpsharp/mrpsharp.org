## Electron flow
1. Calculate the rate at which electrons flow around a circuit at a current of 1A.
1. What kind of speed would you estimate they move at?

1. Use the equation *I = nvqA* to estimate the speed at which electrons move in a copper wire carrying 1A. You may use the equipment in the lab to help.
