## Simple uncertainty estimates

1. A metre rule is used to measure the side of a desk. What is the size of the uncertainty?
1. A stopwatch is used to time a ball falling to the ground from 1.2 m.
  1. What is the resolution of a standard stopwatch?
  1. What is the largest uncertainty in this reading? What is its cause?
1. A temperature probe is used to measure the temperature in various places in a lab giving readings of: 25.5&deg;C, 26.2&deg;C, 24.8&deg;C, 25.1&deg;C and 37.1&deg;C.
  1. Are any of these readings likely to be anomalies?
  1. Calculate a value for the temperature in the room and estimate the uncertainty.

## Combining uncertainties

1. A pontoon at a yacht club is measured as having dimensions of 8.0m x 2.1m x 60cm. The larger two measurements were completed with a measuring tape with a resolution of 0.1m and the smallest measurement with a metre rule. The pontoon is found to have a mass of 1.81 tons. Calculate the average density and include an estimate of uncertainty. Also indicate what you would do to improve the precision of the measurement.

1. **Bonus:** If the pontoon is made of steel plate (*&rho; = 7880 kg m<sup>-3</sup>*), calculate the thickness of this steel.

???

Density = 179 kg/m^3
Max density = 193 kg/m^3
Min density = 167 kg/m^3

Density = 180 &plusmn; 10 kg/m^3

*or* relative unc. in &rho; 1.25% + 6.0% + 0.16% + 0.06% = 7.5%
= &plusmn; 13.3 => &rho; = 180 &plusmn; 10 kg m<sup>-3</sup>
