# Welcome Upper Shell Physicists

Before answering any Physics questions you must read and follow [Answering Questions in Physics](/answering-questions-in-physics.html).  **If you do not do this then you will find your answers returned!**

Below you will find a list of resources by topic, most of them preps.  You can print these out or complete them by hand on a computer.  Once all are marked I will publish the answers...

You may also want to check out the following:
 * [The Physics Department Homepage](https://homepages.westminster.org.uk/physics/home.asp)
 * [The Edexcel IGCSE page](http://www.edexcel.com/quals/igcse/int-gcse11/physics/Pages/default.aspx): From here you can download the specification and look at past papers.
