# The discovery of the nucleus (Cambridge Physics)

All the following refer to the pages at <http://www.cambridgephysics.org>.

## J.J. Thomson's discovery of the electron

1. In what year was J.J. Thomson's discovery?
2. Why are cathode rays so named?
3. Read the information about measuring the mass of an electron.  What modern machine uses the same principle (*you may need to do a web search!*)

## Ernst Rutherford's discovery of the nucleus

1. What was the distinction Rutherford drew between alpha rays and beta rays?
2. What did Geiger and Marsden use as the source of their alpha particles?
3. Describe the Geiger Marsden experiment, highlighting the key points.
4. What was the most surprising result?
5. What was the conclusion drawn about the nucleus from,
	1. The fact that most alpha particles were undisturbed.
	2. The fact that some alpha particles were are reflected.
6. If an atom was the size of Hooke (estimate!), how large would the nucleus be?
