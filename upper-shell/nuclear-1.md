   1. Explain why the experiment was carried out in a vacuum.
   2. The alpha source was surrounded by lead shielding with a long narrow opening at the front.  Give *two* reasons for this.
   3. Some scientists thought that the atom consisted of equally spaced positive and negative charges.
   4. Describe the model of the atom which this experiment led to.

1. Create a table listing the number of protons, neutrons and electrons for the two most abundance isotopes of uranium.

1. Isotopes of the same element cannot be separated by chemical means.
    1. Explain why this is.
    2. Describe *two * different methods which are used commercially to separate isotopes of the same element.
