# Nuclear Physics

## Introduction
*	Notion of the atom as an indivisible entity
*	6th Century BC Indian philosophers
*	5th Century BC Greek philosopher - Democritus
*	Mediaeval Islamic philosophers absorbed ideas from India and China
*	Early 19th Century AD - John Dalton
*	Observation of simple volume ratios of reacting gases
*	Atomic theory of matter only widely accepted by about 1830
*	Thomson’s discovery of the electron
*	Demonstration: fine beam tube to hint at discovery and measurement
*	Implications of the discovery
*	Nature of ions as gain or loss of charge
*	Thomson’s plum pudding model
*	Plum pudding model was reasonable - mixes opposite charges
*	What was the nature of the ‘dough’ in the plum pudding model?

Equipment

## Rutherford scattering
*	Purpose of the Geiger & Marsden experiment
*	Expectations of the Geiger & Marsden experiment
*	Geiger and Marsden’s observations
*	Demonstration: Chinese hat model
*	Concept of a nucleus
*	The Rutherford-Bohr solar system model
*	Size of the atom and the nucleus
