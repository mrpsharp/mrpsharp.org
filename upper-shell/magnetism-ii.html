## D.C. Motor
In a simple d.c. electric motor:

i. The split ring commutator changes the direction of the current in the armature coils every half turn

ii. The force acting on the coils of the armature only depends on the strength of the magnetic field

iii. The armature is made of plastic. This is because it must not be magnetic and should not conduct electricity

Which of the above statements are TRUE?

1. (i) only
2. (ii) only
3. (iii) only
4. (i) and (ii) only
5. (i) and (iii) only

## Electrical Power

1. What is the potential difference across a heater which develops 42 W when 3.5 A flows through it?
1. What is the power rating of a 529&ohm; light bulb which operates from the mains (230 V)?
1. Assuming its resistance is constant, by what factor does the power dissipated in a resistor change if the p.d. is doubled.

1. The lights at the front of a supertanker are 900m from the generator. The wire has a specific resistance of 0.22m&ohm; m <sup>-1</sup>. If the generator outputs 24V and the lights are rated at 24V/100W, calculate:

    1. The resistance of the lights;
    1. The total resistance of the circuit;
    1. The potential difference across the lights;
    1. The actual power output of the lights.

???
1. V = P/I = 12V
1. P = V^2/R = 100W
1. Four times
