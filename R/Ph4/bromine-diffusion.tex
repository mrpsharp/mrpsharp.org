\title{Bromine Diffusion}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

A capsule of bromine is broken in a fume cupboard. After \SI{500}{\second} the bromine has diffused a distance of \SI{0.2}{\metre}. Given that the room temperature is \SI{25}{\celsius}, calculate the number of collisions a typical bromine molecule undergoes in this time and the average distance it travels between collisions.
