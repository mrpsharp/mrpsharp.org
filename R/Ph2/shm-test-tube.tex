\title{Simple Harmonic Motion of a test tube}

\begin{document}
\maketitle\thispagestyle{empty}
At equilibrium a test tube floats because the upthrust due to the water is equal to its weight. At a displacement $x$ from equilibrium the volume of water displaced is $\left(x+x_0\right)A$ where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the test-tube.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write down a formula for the balanced forces at equilibrium.  Your formula should include $x_0$. Also rearrange your formula to give $x_0=$.\vspace{2cm} 
    \item Write down a formula for the acceleration when the test tube is displaced a distance $x$ from equilibrium and simplify it using the first equation to get the formula as a function of $x$ and $x_0$. \vspace{3cm}
    \item Rewrite the formula as a differential equation and complete the formula below which will enable a prediction of the natural frequency $f$ of the system. \vspace{3cm} \[\left(2\pi f\right)^2 = \] 
    \item Carry out the experiment and use your expression above to determine $g$.
\end{enumerate}
