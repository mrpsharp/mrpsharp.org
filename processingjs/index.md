## Processing.js
[Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) is an excellent way to programme simple physical simulations. See the website for more information.

To get started quickly download the sample project I have put together. Rename the folder with your project name and then open index.html in a webbrowser. You can edit *processing.pde* and then reload your project as much as you like.
